This repository will be the final project of my DevOps + Cloud study plan.

The idea to build a complete application infrastructure, with:

  ## Expected steps:

 -[X] Linux fundamentals, Git, Shell Script
 -[] Docker fundamentals

  For now, this repository serves as a motivational anchor to track my progress.
